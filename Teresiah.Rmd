## R Markdown

#Our first section

Today we are learning about markdown. See example above
```{r}
dorcas <- c("Tired","Sleepy","Home")
for(i in 1:length(dorcas)){
  cat("This is true definition of being exhausted",dorcas[i],"\n")
}
```


##Second section
###Third section

#Section Another

Our next chunk is importing data form the base directory.
```{r}
dat <-  read.csv("Dpdata.csv")
dat
```


###Simple Analysis
```{r}
tab1 <- table(dat$Weight)
tab1
tab1 <- data.frame(tab1)
tab1
names(tab1) <- c("labels","frequencies")
names(tab1)
```




This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
